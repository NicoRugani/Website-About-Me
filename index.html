                    Hello, my name is Nicholas Rugani, or just Nico. I am an aspiring software developer out of Ballwin Missouri. I started Coding in 2023 through a program called Web and Computer programming at a technical high school called South Tech High School.
                    Before South Tech I had an interest in computers and had already built several of my own.
                    Throughout my time at South Tech, I've developed skills in many different programming languages, including:
                </p>

                    <li>HTML & CSS</li>
                    <li>Javascript</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Currently I am also in the process of teaching myself SwiftUI using various tools on the internet.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you would like to learn more about me, my projects, goals, or if you would like to contact me please continute to explore the rest of my site!</p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Computers!</h3>
                <br>
                <p>As you may have guessed one of my intrests is computer science.
                    although I am primarily a software developer I do still enjoy learning about all types of aspects of computer science. Wether that be data bases, cyber security, and everything in between its all at least a little interesting to me.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Sports</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Currently in high school, I play water polo and I dive.
                I also have a history of playing lacrosse. Although I don't currently play I still love the game and find myself watching pro and college games all the time.
                <img id = "sports-pic" src = "img/IMG_1043.jpeg" alt = "place holder" width="400px">
                Another one of the sports I play is pickle ball. My friends and I picked up pickle ball origonally for just something to do on the weekends but it has quickly spiraled into a very competative leauge within our friend group.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                
                <h3>Friends</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Spending time with friends is one of the most important things to me.
                    I value all my friendsships greatly and the bonds I've been able to form throughout my years has positivly impacted me for the rest of my life.
